# 2D Physics Engine 

**Overview**

This is a 2D physics engine designed for simulating real-time rigid body dynamics, written in C++ and rendered with OpenGL. It provides functionality for handling collisions, forces, and constraints while maintaining high performance and accuracy.

**Features**

Rigid Body Dynamics: Simulates 2D objects with mass, velocity, and rotational movement.

Collision Detection: Supports AABB, Circle, and Polygon collision detection.

Collision Resolution: Implements impulse-based resolution for realistic responses.

Forces and Constraints: Supports gravity, friction, restitution, and basic constraints.

Broad-phase and Narrow-phase Detection: Optimized for efficiency.
